 * The eight great ideas in computer architecture are similar to ideas
 * from other fields. Match the eight ideas from computer architecture,
 * “Design for Moore’s Law”, “Use Abstraction to Simplify Design”, “Make
 * the Common Case Fast”, “Performance via Parallelism”, “Performance via
 * Pipelining”, “Performance via Prediction”, “Hierarchy of Memories”, and 
 * “Dependability via Redundancy” to the following ideas from other fields:
 
 * a. Assembly lines in automobile manufacturing
 * b. Suspension bridge cables
 * c. Aircraft and marine navigation systems that incorporate wind information
 * d. Express elevators in buildings
 * e. Library reserve desk
 * f. Increasing the gate area on a CMOS transistor to decrease its switching time
 * g. Adding electromagnetic aircraft catapults (which are electrically-powered as 
 * opposed to current steam-powered models), allowed by the increased power generation
 * offered by the new reactor technology
 * h. Building self-driving cars whose control systems partially rely on existing sensor 
 * systems already installed into the base vehicle, such as lane departure systems and 
 * smart cruise control systems
